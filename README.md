# Happy Thoughts

In this project we were working with an API and made a small Twitter-like application that collects and shows 'Happy Thougths' where we can all share our happy thoughts and 'heart' them. 

## The problem

We are using React to build this app and working with GET and POST requests (POST requests for the first time).
